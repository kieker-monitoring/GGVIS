# Grouped Graph Visualizer (GGVIS)

## About

This tool is made to work in tandem with the Kieker MVIS tool.
Based on the Tulip Framework, it can take as input both dot and graphml and render out a nested graph based on common dot separated component names (a.b.c).
Consult the `--help` option for more information.
