# Grouped Graph Visualizer (GGVIS)

## About

This tool works alongside the Kieker MVIS tool.
It uses the Tulip Framework to read .dot and .graphml files and renders nested graphs based on dot-separated component names like a.b.c.
Other Graphviz layout engines, such as dot and fdp, are available for comparison.
Run with --help to see available options.
